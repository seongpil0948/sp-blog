<!--
Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.

Create tracking issue using the Snowplow event tracking template. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Snowplow%20event%20tracking.md
-->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt. https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#cross-stage-features -->

### Is this a cross-stage feature?

<!-- Label reminders - you should have one of each of the following labels.
Use the following resources to find the appropriate labels:
- Use only one tier label choosing the lowest tier this is intended for
- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/labels
